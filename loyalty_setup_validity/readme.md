loyalty_setup_validity
=========

Normally, the loyalty program is based on a fixed validity date. With this module, you can choose between a fixed date or a date generated within a period of time after the loyalty has been generated (for example, after a visit to the point of sale, a customer can obtain a discount for 30 days).
